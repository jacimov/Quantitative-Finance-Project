# Security Quick Reference

## ‚úÖ Your Repository is Secure!

No exposed API keys or secrets were found. Here's what you need to know:

## Files Added for Your Security

1. **`.env.example`** - Template for your API credentials
   - Copy to `.env` and fill in your real keys
   - `.env` is already in `.gitignore` and will never be committed

2. **`SECURITY.md`** - Complete security guide
   - Best practices for credential management
   - Step-by-step setup instructions
   - Recommendations for tools and practices

3. **`SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md`** - Detailed audit findings
   - Complete analysis of the security scan
   - Specific findings for each file
   - Recommendations and next steps

## Quick Setup (3 Steps)

```bash
# 1. Copy the template
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Edit with your real credentials
nano .env  # or use your preferred editor

# 3. Verify it's ignored
git status  # .env should NOT appear in untracked files
```

## What's in Your .env File

```bash
ALPACA_API_KEY=your_real_key_here
ALPACA_API_SECRET=your_real_secret_here
OANDA_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_real_token_here
OANDA_ACCOUNT_ID=your_real_account_id_here
KALSHI_API_KEY_ID=your_real_key_id_here
```

## Security Best Practices

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Use environment variables for all credentials
- Keep `.env` file local only (never commit it)
- Use paper trading accounts for testing
- Enable 2FA on all trading platforms
- Rotate API keys regularly

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Hardcode API keys in source code
- Share your `.env` file
- Commit credentials to git
- Use production keys for testing
- Share API keys in issues or pull requests

## Verify Your Security

```bash
# Check what would be committed (should not include .env)
git status

# Verify .env is ignored
git check-ignore -v .env
# Should output: .gitignore:10:.env	.env

# Check for any accidental secrets
git diff  # Before committing
```

## Need Help?

- See `SECURITY.md` for complete documentation
- See `SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md` for audit details
- All example code uses placeholders like `YOUR_API_KEY`
- All production code uses `os.getenv()` correctly
